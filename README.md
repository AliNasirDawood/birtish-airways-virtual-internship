# Problem Statement
The main challenge was to design a dynamic web scraping solution using the Selenium framework, with the goal of extracting comprehensive data from an entire website. The scraper should navigate through the website, simulate user interactions, handle dynamic content loaded via Bs4, and systematically gather relevant information store them in a csv.
# Solution
The proposed solution involves creating a dynamic web scraper using the Selenium framework. This scraper will navigate through a target website, handling user interactions and dynamic content. The process begins by initializing a web driver and opening the website. For dealing with dynamic content loaded via Bs4, the scraper will employ Selenium's wait mechanisms to ensure complete page loading. Data extraction will be performed using CSS selectors or XPath to locate and extract the desired information from HTML elements. The scraped data will be stored in a structured format for analysis.
